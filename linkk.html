    <p class="para">The Indian Army on Monday apprehended a Chinese soldier in eastern Ladakh. According to the Indian Army's recent statement which says that 'the soldier strayed for a yak which misplaced in that region and unfortunately he crossed the LAC. While Chinese Army officials said:
"We hope that the Indian side will live up to its promise to hand over the missing Chinese soldier as soon as possible and implement the consensus reached by the two sides in the 7th round of Senior Commanders meeting, to maintain peace and tranquility in the border" 
     and in response, the Indian Army took the charge and also said that after the investigation the soldier will be handed over to PLA with the completion of procedures.
               Well, the Chinese soldier identified as of Corporal rank and named as Wang Ya Long when he strayed down that time his condition was not so good, he was shivering and unable to breathe properly but the Indian Army provided him everything which shows the professionalism of Indian Army even when we have border tensions to that country only. 
    Although, the soldier was handed over to PLA on Tuesday night by army officials.
 As the tensions are growing worst day-by-day, therefore, this type of situation can make it worse but our army doesn't want it to make it worse. Although, if the corporal finds them as spy then Army definitely take action against him he was clean.
 Although, the time arrived as winter and both the armies are standing on other sides with full preparation and it doesn't seem that both the army will deescalate in the coming hours.
 Even, 6 major talks happened earlier but no results comes out through that. Let's see what the future seems to be.
       To know more about it in the future, stay tuned!
 Jai Hind!</p></container>
